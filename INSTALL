PREREQUISITS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program only requires libraries that are included in IRIX 6.5, but may
not be installed by default. They are:

   libXmu.so  =>    /usr/lib32/libXmu.so   
   libXm.so.2  =>   /usr/lib32/libXm.so.2  
   libXt.so  =>     /usr/lib32/libXt.so    
   libX11.so.1  =>  /usr/lib32/libX11.so.1 
   libm.so  =>      /usr/lib32/libm.so     
   libc.so.1  =>    /usr/lib32/libc.so.1   
   libXext.so  =>   /usr/lib32/libXext.so  
   libgen.so  =>    /usr/lib32/libgen.so   
   libXpm.so.2  =>  /usr/lib32/libXpm.so.2 
   
Specifically, the default is to link with the Motif 2.1 libraries that are
part of the IRIX 6.5 feature stream. They can easily be redirected to the
maintainance stream's Motif 1.2 libraries by editing the makefile.

When building with gcc or an older (pre-R10K) system, the -mips4 compiler option
should be changed to -mips3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build from the source code just cd to the directory containing the source
and issue the shell command

   gmake iconbar
   
which assumes that GNU make has been installed. If not, it is availible from
http://freeware.sgi.com. The make script will use the CC environment variable
if it is set for its ANSI C compiler, or else just defaults to cc.

Alternately, if not all of the prerequisits are met, you might try

   gmake mips3 
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, the makefile will install the executable in /usr/local/bin, the
man page in /usr/local/man/man1. To select different installation locations,
set the BINDIR and MANDIR environment variables. If the directories don't exist
that will be created (assuming the permissions are set correctly).

To install:

   gmake install
   
or for the mips3, Motif 1.2 version,

   gmake install-mips3
